1. What is Software Testing ?
  Software Testing is a process of finding bugs and errors in the software. Its goal is to give enough confidence to the stakeholders to release the software to clients.
  In general, you can divide software testing into two broad categories, namely manual testing and automated testing.
  Manual Testing : A human tester manually tests the software, performing all the actions that the real users are supposed to take.
  Automated Testing : A software tool conducts the testing, programmatically executing the code under the test, providing the pre-configured inputs, and verifying the actual output with the expected result.

2. What is SDLC ?
  SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process.
