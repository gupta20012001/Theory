1. What is Java and types of data type ?
  1. Java is a high level,object-oriented programming language that was developed by James Gotling at 1995.
  2. It is platform-independent, meaning that programs written can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine(JVM) installed.
  3. There are two tpes of data types defined in the java - 
    i. primitive - This type of data is predefined by Java. We just use them to provide the data type for the input. These data types are defined as below - 
      - byte
      - short
      - int
      - long
      - float
      - double
      - char
      - boolean
    ii. non-primitive - This type of data type can be customized by the user. These are as below -
      - String
      - array

2. Why is Java not a pure Object-Oriented Programming Language ?
  Java supports primitive data types - byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

3. What is Instance and Local Variable ?
  Instance Variable - Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.
Example -
class Athlete {
  public string athleteName;
  public double athletespeed;
  public int athleteage;
}

  Local Variable - Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. Whenever a local Variable is declared inside a method, the other class methods don't have any knowledge about the local Variable.
Example - 
public void athlete() {
  String athleteName;
  double athletespeed;
  int athleteage;
}

Instance vs Local Variables
class Athlete {
  public String athleteName;
  public double athletespeed;
  public int athleteage;

  public Athlete(name,speed,age) {
    this.athleteName = name;
    this.athletespeed = speed;
    this.athleteage = age;
  }

  public void athleteRun() {
    int speed = 100;
    System.out.println("Athlete runs at" + speed + "km/hr");
  }
}

In class Athlete, athleteName, athletespeed, athleteage are instance variables.
name, speed, age and int speed = 100 are the local variables.

4. What do you mean by data encapsulation ?
  1. Data encapsulation is an object-oriented programming concept of hiding the data attributes and their behaviours in a single unit.
  2. It helps developers to follow modularity while developing software by ensuring that each object is independent of other objects by having its own methods, attributes, and functionalities.
  3. It is used for the security of the private properties of an object and hence serves the purposes of data hiding.
class {
  data members(properties)
      +
  methods(behaviour)
}
