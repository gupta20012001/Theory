1. What is Java and types of data type ?
  1. Java is a high level,object-oriented programming language that was developed by James Gotling at 1995.
  2. It is platform-independent, meaning that programs written can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine(JVM) installed.
  3. There are two tpes of data types defined in the java - 
    1. primitive - This type of data is predefined by Java. We just use them to provide the data type for the input. These data types are defined as below - 
      - byte
      - short
      - int
      - long
      - float
      - double
      - char
      - boolean
    2. non-primitive - This type of data type can be customized by the user. These are as below -
      - String
      - array

2. Why is Java not a pure Object-Oriented Programming Language ?
  Java supports primitive data types - byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

3. What is Instance and Local Variable ?
  Instance Variable - Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.
